# Eat a Burger

## OverView
In this assignment, we create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!).

## Process
The user will have a selection of hamburgers they would like to eat. Once eaten the burgers will be moved to devoured and the user has the option to eat the hamburger again.

The User will also have an option to add a burger to the database and decide if its been eaten or not. 

## Results
